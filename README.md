The goal of this project is to create a modular and open architecture for interactive radio campaigns. Interactive radio adds participatory elements to radio through the use of mobile phones and other communication technologies. Some of the channels over which this two-way communication can take place are:
* IVR
* SMS
* Chatbots
* Speech-to-text
<!-- between campaign features and an audience -->
