The goal of this project is to create a modular and open architecture for interactive radio campaigns. Interactive radio adds participatory elements to radio through the use of mobile phones and other communication technologies. Some channels over which two-way communication between campaign features and the audience can take place are:
* IVR
* SMS
* Chatbots
* Speech-to-text
